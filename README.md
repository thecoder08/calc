# Graphing calculator
This is a tool to plot a function with its derivative and integral. I made it because I wanted to learn how computers and software like Desmos can do calculus.

The initial function is plotted in red, the derivative in green, and the integral in blue.

It uses libxgfx to draw to a window on X11 and Wayland.
